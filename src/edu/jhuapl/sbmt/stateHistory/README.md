## File format

To this date (03.24.2020) there has been no set format for the state history files.  They have been CSV files that describe various components of the state of the spacecraft at a given time.  These points are pulled from a data file set at a 10 minute cadence; that file is generated and stored on the server during model creation or at data pipeline processing time. This section will discuss both this format as well as the format going forward when SPICE kernels are available
